The files in this directory have been forked from LSST's pex_config module, as
it was on 17 November 2017, and modified slightly to support Gemini's DRAGONS
pipeline. LSST has kindly agreed to provide this code under a 3-clause BSD
license (as an alternative option to their existing GNU General Public License,
mentioned in the source files); see extern_licenses/pex_config. We are hoping
to converge with LSST's upstream version once we no longer need support for
Python 2.
