class fit_1D:
    """
    A class for evaluating the result of fitting 1D polynomials to each
    vector along some axis of an N-dimensional image array, with iterative
    pixel rejection and re-fitting, similar to IRAF's fit1d.

    Only simple, non-interactive plotting for inspection/debugging is
    implemented here; DRAGONS provides interactive plotting via a separate
    wrapper.


    Parameters
    ----------

    image : array-like
        N-dimensional input array containing the values to be fitted. If
        it is a `numpy.ma.MaskedArray`, any masked points are ignored when
        fitting.

    points : `~numpy.ndarray`, optional
        1-dimensional input array with the x-values of each 1D slice being
        fitted, If not given, the independent variable will be treated as
        a sequence of integers starting at zero.

    weights : `~numpy.ndarray`, optional
        N-dimensional input array containing fitting weights for each point.
        The weights will be ignored for a given 1D fit if all zero, to allow
        processing regions without data (in progress: splines only). If the
        data have known uncertainties, the weights should be equal to the
        inverse of the standard deviation.

    function : {'legendre', 'chebyshev', 'polynomial', 'splineN'}, optional
        Fitting function/model type to be used (current default 'legendre').
        The spline options may be 'spline1' (linear) to 'spline5' (quintic).

    domain : tuple, optional
        Domain for any of the astropy polynomial models. If None, the model
        is fit with a domain equal to the interval covered by the independent
        variable.

    order : `int` or `None`, optional
        Order/degree (ie. highest power, or number of terms minus one) for
        polynomial fitting functions. For spline fits, this is the maximum
        number of spline pieces, which (if applicable) will be reduced in
        proportion to the number of masked pixels for each fit. The default of
        0 always fits a constant. A value of `None` uses as many pieces as
        required to get chi^2=1 for spline fits, while for other functions it
        maps to the default of 0. Note that the equivalent value for polynomial
        functions in IRAF is 1 greater than with this definition.

    axis : `int`, optional
        Array axis along which to perform fitting (Python convention;
        default -1, ie. rows).

    sigma_lower, sigma_upper : `float`, optional
        Rejection threshold in standard deviations below and above the mean,
        respectively (default 3.0).

    niter : `int`, optional
        Maximum number of rejection and re-fitting iterations (default 0, ie.
        a single fit with no iteration).

    grow : `float` or `False`, optional
        Distance within which to extend rejection to the neighbours of
        statistically-rejected pixels (eg. 1 for the nearest neighbours).

    regions : `str` or list of `slice`, optional
        One or more comma-separated pixel ranges to be used in fitting each
        1D model. If this is a string, each range is 1-indexed, inclusive of
        the upper limit and may use a colon or hyphen separator. An upper or
        lower limit may be omitted, to use the remainder of the axis. The
        default of `None` (or '*' or '') causes the entire axis to be used.
        Any data outside the specified range(s) are ignored in fitting (even
        if those ranges are completely masked in the input `image`). If the
        argument is a list of slice objects, they follow the usual Python
        indexing conventions.

    plot : `bool` or `tuple` of `int`
        Plot a sample 1D fit to `image`? If `True`, the central (rounded up)
        1D fit will be plotted. A different fit can be selected by providing a
        co-ordinate tuple (using Python convention) with the fitted `axis`
        omitted, eg. (24, 34) would fit the central spectrum of an IFU data cube
        with shape (2822, 49, 68). For 2D data only, a single row/column number
        may be provided without parentheses. The default is `False` (no plot).

    Attributes
    ----------

    The arguments that control fitting and rejection (`function`, `order`,
    `axis`, `sigma_lower`, `sigma_upper`, `niter`, `grow` and `regions`) are
    stored in like-named attributes, in addition to which the following are
    defined:

    mask : `~numpy.ndarray`
        A Boolean mask matching the input `image` that records which pixels
        (`True`) were ignored when fitting, either because they were already
        masked in the input `image` or because they were rejected statistically
        during the iterative fitting process.

    model_class : `~astropy.modeling.core.Model` or
                  `astromodels.UnivariateSplineWithOutlierRemoval:`
        The underlying class to which the `function` argument has been mapped.

    regions_pix : `tuple` of (`int`, `int`)
        The actual fitted pixel ranges of the input `image` corresponding to
        `regions`, in inclusive, 1-indexed (start, end) pairs, with no
        wildcards or adjacent/overlapping ranges. These are provided primarily
        to facilitate plot annotation.
