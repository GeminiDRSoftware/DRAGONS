    """
    A routine for evaluating the result of fitting 1D polynomials to each
    vector along some axis of an N-dimensional image array, with iterative
    pixel rejection and re-fitting, similar to IRAF's fit1d.

    Only a subset of fit1d functionality is currently supported (not
    including interactivity, other than for debugging purposes). This still
    needs to be made to work for a single 1D input array.

    Parameters
    ----------

    image : array-like
        N-dimensional input array containing the values to be fitted. If
        it is a `numpy.ma.MaskedArray`, any masked points are ignored when
        fitting.

    weights : `ndarray`, optional
        N-dimensional input array containing fitting weights for each point.

    function : {'legendre', 'chebyshev', 'polynomial'}, optional
        Fitting function/model type to be used (current default 'legendre').

    order : `int`, optional
        Order (number of terms or degree+1) of the fitting function
        (default 1).

    axis : `int`, optional
        Array axis along which to perform fitting (Python convention;
        default -1, ie. rows).

    lsigma, hsigma : `float`, optional
        Rejection threshold in standard deviations below and above the mean,
        respectively (default 3.0).

    iterations : `int`, optional
        Number of rejection and re-fitting iterations (default 0, ie. a single
        fit with no iteration).

    regions : `str`, optional
        One or more comma-separated pixel ranges to be used in fitting each
        1D model. Each range is 1-indexed, inclusive of the upper limit and
        may use a colon or hyphen separator. An upper or lower limit may be
        omitted, to use the remainder of the axis. The default of `None` (or
        '*' or '') causes the entire axis to be used. Any data outside the
        specified range(s) are ignored in fitting (even if those ranges are
        completely masked in the input `image`).

    plot : bool
        Plot the images if True, default is False.

    Returns
    -------

    `ndarray`
        An array of the same shape as the input, whose values are evaluated
        from the polynomial fits to each 1D vector.
