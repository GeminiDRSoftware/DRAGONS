    Find all the significant maxima and minima in a 1D profile. Significance
    is calculated from the prominence of each peak divided by an estimate of
    the noise from the pixel-to-pixel variations in the profile, and whether
    this exceeds the minimum S/N ratio threshold.

    Maxima and minima are found by identifying all pixels that are either
    lower than both their neighbours, or higher than both their neighbours,
    or equal to one neighbour. The precise locations of these extrema are
    then calculated (with any that fail to produce a clear result simply
    being discarded) and any adjacent pairs of minima or maxima (when
    ordered by location) merged to leave only the most prominent. As a
    result, the returned list alternates perfectly between minima and

    Determines the region in a 1D array associated with each already-identified
    peak.

    This function operates in one of two ways:
        1. A list of already-determined extrema (maxima and minima) can be
           provided, in which case each peak is shifted to the nearest
           maximum and the limits determined from the adjacent minima. This
           is the mode of operation during the findApertures() first pass.
        2. If not list is provided, extrema are calculated, each peak is
           shifted, and then extrema are recaculated based on the S/N of
           this peak, and the limits determined. This is the mode of operation
           if the user marks a new aperture in the findApertures() UI, which
           may be less significance than the nominal minimum S/N ratio.

    Limits are determined between the peak and the adjacent minimum, which is
    assumed to represent the continuum level (since we do not require that
    data have a continuum level of zero).

    mask: ndarray (bool-like)
        mask indicating pixels in data to ignore
    variance: ndarray/None
        variance of each pixel (None => recalculate)
    peaks: sequence
        peaks for which limits are to be found
    threshold: float
        parameter that determines where to place the aperture edge
        between the peak and the continuum level
    min_snr: float
        minimum S/N ratio for detection (used to find minima if
        extrema is None)
    extrema: sequence/None
        output from get_extrema(); if not provided, extrema will be calculated
