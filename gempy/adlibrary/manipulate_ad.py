    """
    If there is only one single length dimension in the pixel data, the
    remove_single_length_dimension function will remove the single length
    dimension. In addition, this function removes any keywords associated with
    that dimension. Used ONLY by the standardizeStructure primitive in
    primitives_F2.py.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adinput : AstroData
        input AD object

    Returns
    -------
