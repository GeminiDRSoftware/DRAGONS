class UserDB(CalDB):
    """
    The class handling the User-defined database, which can contain:
    (a) a filename for each caltype that should be returned whenever that
        caltype is requested, irrespective of the AD "making" the request
    (b) a filename to be returned for a given caltype for a specific AD
        (actually, a specific ad.calibration_key(), which is normally just
        the data label)

    This class also handles the standard MDFs when a "mask" is requested.

    Attributes
    ----------
    user_cals : dict
        A dict of {caltype: filename} as described in (a) above
    user_cache : dict
        A dict of {(calibration_key, caltype): filename} as described in (b)
        This is cached to disk as a pickle.
    mdf_dict : dict
        A dict of {mdf_key: filename} for the standard focal plane masks
