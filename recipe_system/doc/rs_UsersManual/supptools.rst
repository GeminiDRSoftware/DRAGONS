Supplemental tools
==================

DRAGONS provides a number of command line tools that users should find helpful in
executing ``reduce`` on their data. These supplemental tools can help users
discover information, not only about their own data, but about the Recipe System,
such as available recipes, primitives, and defined tags.

If your environment has been configured correctly these applications will work
directly.
