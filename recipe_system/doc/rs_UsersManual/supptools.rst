Supplemental tools
******************

DRAGONS provides a number of command line tools that users should find helpful
in executing ``reduce`` on their data.  Some of those tools also offer an API.

These supplemental tools can help users discover information, not only
about their own data, but about the Recipe System, such as available
recipes, primitives, and defined tags.

If your environment has been configured correctly these applications will
work directly.
