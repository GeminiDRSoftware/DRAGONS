# QAP SpecViewer 

This folder the QAP SpecViewer, a client written in HTML/CSS/JS that makes 
HTTP/GET requests to the ADCC Server periodically in order to retried a JSON 
file containing the extracted spectra that will be displayed on a browser.

## Requirements

Here are the required packages in order to proper display and run the QAP
SpecViewer client: 
    
* JQuery v1.0.9
* JQuery-UI v1.12.1
* JQPlot v3.4.1

These JavaScript packages are stored inside `./js/` folder.

It is important to notice that the downloaded JQPlot raises an error on 
double-clicking events to reset the zoom of the plots. This can be fixed by 
replacing all the `sel().collapse();` calls by `sel().collapse(null);` in the 
`jqplot.cursor.js` file.

## Running a mock server

Right now, the ADCC Server is not configured to handle requests from QAP 
SpecViewer. Because of that, a mock server was created to handle them. 

This mock server uses [flask v1.1.1](http://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) 
which can be installed via `conda` or via `pip` commands. Once you have it, 
you can run the server using the command lines below: 

```shell script
  $ export FLASK_APP=${DRAGONS_REPO}/recipe_system/adcc/client/qap_specviewer/mock_adcc.py
  $ cd ${DRAGONS_REPO}/recipe_system/adcc/client/qap_specviewer/
  $ flask run  
```

Where `${DRAGONS_REPO}` is the directory to where DRAGONS is cloned.

You will also need to generate a mock JSON file that will be delivered the 
QAP SpecViewer. For that, simply run the command line below:

```shell script
    $ python ${DRAGONS_REPO}/recipe_system/adcc/client/qap_specviewer/mock_json.py
```
