class TagSet(namedtuple('TagSet', 'add remove blocked_by blocks if_present')):
    """
    TagSet(add=None, remove=None, blocked_by=None, blocks=None, if_present=None)

    Named tuple that is used by tag methods to return which actions should be
    performed on a tag set. All the attributes are optional, and any
    combination of them can be used, allowing to create complex tag structures.
    Read the documentation on the tag-generating algorithm if you want to
    better understand the interactions.

    The simplest TagSet, though, tends to just add tags to the global set.

    It can be initialized by position, like any other tuple (the order of the
    arguments is the one in which the attributes are listed below). It can
    also be initialized by name.

    Attributes
    ----------
    add : set of str, or None
        Tags to be added to the global set
    remove : set of str, or None
        Tags to be removed from the global set
    blocked_by : set of str, or None
        Tags that will prevent this TagSet from being applied
    blocks : set of str, or None
        Other TagSets containing these won't be applied
    if_present : set of str, or None
        This TagSet will be applied only *all* of these tags are present

    Examples
    ---------
    >>> TagSet()
    TagSet(add=set(), remove=set(), blocked_by=set(), blocks=set(), if_present=set())
