********************
The AstroData Object
********************

The |AstroData| object is an internal representation of a file on disk.
As of this version, only a FITS layer has been written, but |AstroData| itself
is not limited to FITS.

The internal structure of the |AstroData| object makes uses of
:class:`astropy.nddata.NDData`, :mod:`astropy.table`, and
:class:`astropy.io.fits.Header`, the latter simply because it is a
convenient ordered dictionary.

Global vs Extension-specific
============================
At the very top level, the structure is divided in two types of information.
In the first category, there is the information that applies to the data
globally, for example the information that would be stored in a FITS Primary
Header Unit, a table from a catalog that matches the RA and DEC of the field,
etc.  In the second category, there is the information specific to individual
science pixel extensions, for example the gain of the amplifier, the data
themselves, the error on those data, etc.

Let us look at an example.  The :meth:`~astrodata.AstroData.info` method shows
the content of the |AstroData| object and its organization, from the user's
perspective.::

    >>> import astrodata
    >>> import gemini_instruments

    >>> ad = astrodata.open('../playdata/N20170609S0154_varAdded.fits')
    >>> ad.info()

The "Pixel Extensions" contain the pixel data.  Each extension is represented
individually in a list (0-indexed like all Python lists).  The science pixel
data, its associated metadata (extension header), and any other pixel or table
extensions directly associated with that science pixel data are stored in
a |NDAstroData| object which is a subclass of astropy |NDData|. We will
return to this structure later. An |AstroData| extension is accessed like
any list: ``ad[0]``. To access the science pixels, one uses ``ad[0].data``; for
the object mask of the first extension, ``ad[0].OBJMASK``.

In the example above, the "Other Extensions" at the bottom of the
:meth:`~astrodata.AstroData.info` display contains a ``REFCAT`` table which in
this case is a list of stars from a catalog that overlaps the field of view of
covered by the pixel data. The "Other Extensions" are global extensions. They
are not attached to any pixel extension in particular. To access a global
extension one simply uses the name of that extension: ``ad.REFCAT``.


Organization of the Global Information
======================================
All the global information is stored in attributes of the |AstroData| object.
The global headers, or Primary Header Unit (PHU), is stored in the ``phu``
attribute as an :class:`astropy.io.fits.Header`.

Any global tables, like ``REFCAT`` above, are stored in the private attribute
``_tables`` as a Python dictionary with the name (eg. "REFCAT") as the key.
All tables are stored as :class:`astropy.table.Table`. Access to those table
is done using the key directly as if it were a normal attributed, eg.
``ad.REFCAT``. Header information for the table, if read in from a FITS table,
is stored in the ``meta`` attribute of the :class:`astropy.table.Table`, eg.
``ad.REFCAT.meta['header']``. It is for information only, it is not used.


Organization of the Extension-specific Information
==================================================
The pixel data are stored in the |AstroData| attribute ``nddata`` as a list
of |NDAstroData| object. The |NDAstroData| object is a subclass of astropy
|NDData| and it is fully compatible with any function expecting an |NDData| as
input.  The pixel extensions are accessible through slicing, eg. ``ad[0]`` or
even ``ad[0:2]``. A slice of an AstroData object is an AstroData object, and
all the global attributes are kept. For example::

    >>> ad[0].info()

    .REFCAT        Table       (245, 16)

Note how ``REFCAT`` is still present.

The science data is accessed as ``ad[0].data``, the variance as ``ad[0].variance``,
and the data quality plane as ``ad[0].mask``.   Those familiar with astropy
|NDData| will recognize the structure "data, error, mask", and will notice
some differences. First |AstroData| uses the variance for the error plane, not
the standard deviation. Another differences will be evident only when one looks
at the content of the mask. |NDData| masks contain booleans, |AstroData| masks
are ``uint16`` bit mask that contains information about the type of bad pixels
rather than just flagging them a bad or not. Since ``0`` is equivalent to
``False`` (good pixel), the |AstroData| mask is fully compatible with the
|NDData| mask.

Header information for the extension is stored in the |NDAstroData| ``meta``
attribute.  All table and pixel extensions directly associated with the
science extension are also stored in the ``meta`` attribute.

Technically, an extension header is located in ``ad.nddata[0].meta['header']``.
However, for obviously needed convenience, the normal way to access that header
is ``ad[0].hdr``.

Tables and pixel arrays associated with a science extension are
stored in ``ad.nddata[0].meta['other']`` as a dictionary keyed on the array
name, eg. ``OBJCAT``, ``OBJMASK``.   As it is for global tables, astropy tables
are used for extension tables.  The extension tables and extra pixel arrays are
accesses, like the global tables, by using the table name rather than the long
format, for example ``ad[0].OBJCAT`` and ``ad[0].OBJMASK``.

When reading FITS Table, the header information is stored in the
``meta['header']`` of the table, eg. ``ad[0].OBJCAT.meta['header']``.  That
information is not used, it is simply a place to store what was read from disk.

The header of a pixel extension directly associate with the science extension
should match that of the science extension.  Therefore such headers are not
stored in |AstroData|. For example, the header of ``ad[0].OBJMASK`` is the
same as that of the science, ``ad[0].hdr``.

A Note on Memory Usage
======================
When an file is opened, the headers are loaded into memory, but the pixels
are not. The pixel data are loaded into memory only when they are first
needed. This is not real "memory mapping", more of a delayed loading. This
is useful when someone is only interested in the metadata, especially when
the files are very large.
