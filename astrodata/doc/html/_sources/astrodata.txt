Gemini Astrodata 
*****************

Introduction to Astrodata
=========================

Astrodata is a module  in Python designed to handle sets of 
astronomical data as a single unit. Currently Astrodata only supports 
data in Multi-extension FITS files (MEF) coming from the Gemini instruments.
The goal is to provide an interface for the non-professional programmer to easily
access FITS header values and data in a way that is non instrument dependent.

Intended Audience
=================

If you have not seen Python  you could start with Example 2 for an introductory 
examples of Astrodata usage.

If you know IDL already, then you could quickly become familiar with Python as the
syntax is very similar, with a noticeable exception that Python does not use 
curly braces nor 'begin' or 'end' but rather relies on blocks of statements.

Required software
=================

To use this tutorial you need some modules that are part of the default Python
distribution: the Astrodata module is available internaly via the Gemini DPD group;
the Numpy module is also needed for numerical array calculation and it might
be part of your Python installation.

   # Starting PYTHON in unix and MacOS.

3. Line by line explanation of Example2
---------------------------------------

**Line 1:  #! /usr/bin/env python**

    If you want to run the Python script as a Unix command, this statement
    tells the UNIX shell that indeed is a Python program and loads the
    interpreter.


**Line 3:  from astrodata.AstroData import AstroData, prepOutput**

 Python modules that are not part of the default installation 
 need to be loaded using some of these constructions. 
 'from astrodata.AstroData import AstroData, prepOutput': Will look at the directory 
 'astrodata' and load the Python file 'AstroData.py' in that
 directory; from this file, it will make available the class Astrodata and the
 function prepOutput.
 The pathname to this directory needs to be accessible
 via the environment variable PYTHONPATH.


**Line 6:  def ADUToElectron(filelist, outprefix, verbose)**

 This is the function definition, its name is 'ADUToElectron'. 
 When calling it you must give the one or more filenames in a list
 and the output prefix for the output files as a string, verbose is a
 True/ False argument. 


**Line 13:   for filename in filelist:**
 
 The first line is a DO loop statement. It will take each
 element of 'filelist' and put the value in 'filename'.

**Line 16:  adinput = AstroData(file, mode='readonly')**

 This is the starting point of the 'astrodata' usage. We are opening
 a file and returning a list of FITS HDUs (header data units), and functions. To see
 a list of these functions please type 'dir adinput' in your Python shell. For help
 on any: 'help adinput.phuValue'

**Line 19: if adinput.phuValue('ELECTRON') != None:**

 This function looks for the value of the PHU (primary header unit) keyword 'ELECTRON';
 if there is no such keyword, it returns the value 'None'.

**Line 34: adout = prepOutput(adinput, outputname)**

 This function returns an AstroData object with the PHU of the input 
 file. The output filename will be 'outputname'.

**Line 39: gain = ad.gain()**

 The fits file openned has gain information in each of the EHUs (extension header
 unit). This command returns a python list with those values. 
 It assumes that the keyword name is 'GAIN'.


**Line 46: adc = deepcopy(adinput)**

 Make a new copy of the input Astrodata object; we do not want to 
 change the input data in memory.

**Line 47: for extension,g,xn in zip(adinput, gain, range(len(gain))):**

 This is a compound Do loop statement of the form 'for VARS in LIST'.
 The 'zip' function takes as arguments one or more Python lists and
 returns a list of tuples, with one element at a time. For example:
 zip([1,2],['a','b']), returns [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')]. The function 'range(n)'
 takes an integer and expands it into an increasing sequence from 0..n-1.
  
 The VARS will then contain one set of tuples at a time.

**Line 48:   extension.data = extension.data * g**

 'extension' is a python  object containing the pixel area data among other things.
 we just replace those values with the new ones. This is a memory operation
 and does not affect the input file.

**Line 49:   adout.append(data=extension.data, header=extension.header)**

 We now append a new FITS extension to the output file with its data and header.

**Line 52: adout.phuSetKeyValue('ELECTRON', fits_utc(), \\**
           **comment='UT Modified with convertToElectrons')**

 Appends the indicated keyword to the PHU; its value is the value of the function
 'fits_utc()' defined at the end of the Example1. Notice that Python
 allows for a statement to be broken in different lines; mostly a 
 comma is a good line separator.

**Line 56: adout.write()**

 Writes to disk the updated output AstroData object. The filename was already
 defined in 'prepOutput()'

4.  Example 3: Getting information from list of GEMINI FITS file
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 2 is an interactive Python session with separate commands that give
you results right at the terminal.

Example 3 is a Python script written into a text file which you can run at the Unix
prompt or as a single command in the Python Shell.

Copy and paste the source below is a Python called 'list_FITS_info.py'

**Running from Unix**

     Notice that this file contains one function called 'list_info' and that the
     first line is '#! /usr/bin/env python' telling the UNIX system to use the
     Python interpreter to execute the rest of the script. This happens when you
     type 'list_FITS_info.py' at the unix prompt.

     The file needs to have executable mode::

        chmod u+x list_FITS_info.py

     To run 'list_FITS_info.py' simply type::

        list_FITS_info.py
        
        or equivalently

        python list_FITS_info.py    # you do not need execute mode in this case


**Running from the Python Shell**

- Assuming you are where 'list_FITS_info.py' is located.

- Tell Python that you have a file (list_FITS_info.py) with a function
  'list_info'::

     from list_FITS_info import list_info       

     # now run the script:

     list_info()             # The scripts does not have arguments, but you need
                             # the parentheses. 

**list_FITS_info.py**. Copy and paste into a file called 'list_FITS_info.py'::
 
    #! /usr/bin/env python

    from astrodata.AstroData import AstroData
    import glob

    def list_info():

        # Generates a list of FITS files in directory '/data2/rtf_data'
        filelist = glob.glob('/data2/rtf_data/*.fits')
       
        # Placeholder information for the fields to be output
        print 'nsciext: camera: exptime: filtername: instrument: object: ut'

        for file in filelist:         # Loop over all the items in filelist.

            ad = AstroData(file)      # Open the current file

            # Get information for files that are type 'NIRI' and 'GMOS' only.

            if not ad.isType('NIRI') and not ad.isType('GMOS'):
               continue               # Skip to next file in filelist is not
                                      # NIRI nor GMOS

            print '****** ',file

            nxts = ad.countExts('SCI')       # Get number of FITS Science extensions
                                             
            print ad.getTypes()              # show the Astrodata types associated
                                             # with this FITS file and its current
                                             # processing state.
           
            print ad.camera()                # Show the value of the PHU keyword 'CAMERA'
       
            print ad.exptime()               # This is the actual EXPTIME*NCOADDS value

            print ad.filtername()            # Filtername is a unique string discribing 
                                             # the filter for the instrument. 
                                        
            print ad.instrument(), ad.object(), ad.utdate()    # Header keyword values

            if ad.isType('GMOS'):
                if nxts > 0:
                    print "GAIN:", ad.gain()    # print a list of gains
                # Based on the value of the PHU keywords MASKTYPE, MASKNAME
                # and GRATING, the followinf values can be inferred:
                # IMAGE, IFU, LONGSLIST or  MOS.
                print "OBSMODE:", ad.obsmode(),'\n'

            if ad.isType('NIRI'):
                print 'NIRI FILTER header keywords:',\
                # this next form is a Python 'list comprehension' syntax. It is
                # a compressed 'for loop'.
                [(ff+'='+ad.getPHU()[ff]) for ff in ad.rePHUKeys('FILTER\w*')]

                print 'From niri.descriptor:', ad.filtername()
                print 'Non Linear value:', ad.nonlinear()
