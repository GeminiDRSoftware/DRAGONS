    # Well depth from email from Rodrigo Carrasco, 20150824:
    # Detector well depth. GSAOI detector is formed by 4 2kx2k arrays.
    # Each array have different saturation levels and well depth. The
    # lowest saturation level is for array 2. The following table give
    # to you values:
    #
    # Array      Saturation  Gain   Well Depth (e-)      Well Depth (e-)

    #
    # As you can see, the lowest well depth is in array. I suggest to use
    # this value (after non-linearity correction is applied (98000 e-) for
    # all arrays.
    #
    # You have to correct for non-linearity the detectors before you can
    # measure any thing, specially any photometry. When we reduce GSAOI
    # images, we apply the correction for non-linearity first. This is done
    # with the task "gaprepare" inside the GSAOI package. This task also
    # remove the first and last 4 pixels (columns and rows) from each array.
    # These pixels are not illuminated. Then we sky correct and flat field
    # the data. Finally, each array is multiply by the own gain to have all
    # 4 arrays at same level in electrons.
    #
    # What I suggest is to assume one value for the 4 arrays after gain
    # multiplication of 100000 electrons for the well depth (conservative,
    # but should be ok). Note that this well depth is based on Array 2 and
    # is at the 2% from 96% before saturation, after correction for
    # non-linearity.
