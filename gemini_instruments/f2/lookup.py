    # From Ruben Diaz:
    # The zero points for the photometric MKO system were obtained using 88
    # independent data points from standard stars observations made during
    # the three commissioning runs of May through July 2013. The software
    # package THELI (Schirmer 2013) was used.
    # Y = 25.12 - 0.01*k + 0.50*(Y-J) +/- 0.03
    # J = 25.21 - 0.02*k + 0.87*(J-H) +/- 0.05
    # H = 25.42 - 0.01*k + 0.73*(J-H) +/- 0.05
    # Ks= 24.64 - 0.05*k - 0.27*(H-Ks) +/- 0.06
    # (where k is the extinction coefficient.)
    # Updated values from 2014 standards will be available soon.
    # Note: Mischa confirmed k is the airmass
    # Values used assume airmass of 1, and (Y-J), (J-H), (J-H), (H-Ks) = 0
    # EJD
    # Leaving a camera field in the lookup key, in the future when the use of
    # F2 with MCAO (GeMS) is commissioned, the nominal zero points from the
    # f/16 mode and the f/33 mode are expected to differ.

    # NOTE NOTE NOTE
    # The numbers above are for 1 ADU/s not 1 electron/s, so we need to
    # add 2.5*log_10(gain) = 2.5*log_10(4.44) = 1.62 to each of them.
