DETERMINE_WAVELENGTH_SOLUTION_HELP_TEXT = """
<h2>Help</h2>
<p>
    This primitive provides wavelength calibration from a reference
    spectrum (usually of an arc lamp) by identifying peaks in a spectrum
    extracted along the dispersion direction and matching them to features
    with known wavelengths, then fitting a Chebyshev function.
</p>
<p>
    Three plots are shown in the middle of the page. The top plot shows the
    extracted 1D spectrum, with identified lines labeled with their
    wavelengths. The middle plot shows the non-linear component to the fit,
    while the bottom plot shows the residuals about this fit. Some lines in
    the specturm may have been identified but then rejected in subsequent
    iterations (if sigma-clipping is turned on), and these will be shown in
    a different color.
</p>
<p>
    The extraction and initial identifications are controlled by the parameters
    on the left, which initially are those provided to the primitive. The first
    two parameters control the extraction, the next three control the
    peak-finding algorithm, while the last two provide the initial approximate
    (linear) wavelength solution. If the text box is empty and no value is
    shown above the slider, this means that the default is used.
<p>
    By default, the spectrum is extracted along the central rows/columns of
    the image and the feature width is derived from analysis of this
    spectrum. If the central wavelength and dispersion are left blank, the
    initial wavelength solution will be derived from the world coordinate
    system (WCS) of the image. This is derived from keywords in the FITS
    header. It is unlikely you will need to change any of these parameters
    from their defaults.
</p>
<p>
    Incorrect line identifications can be deleted in the top plot by pressing
    the <b>D</b> key close to it. A peak in the spectrum can be assigned a
    reference wavelength (identified) with the <b>I</b> key. This will
    activate the dropdown menu and text box in below the top plot, and
    indicate the pixel location of the peak and its wavelength according to
    the current fit. Up to five lines from the reference linelist will be
    available in the dropdown menu, with the closest one selected and
    also present in the text box. You may select this, or one of the other
    lines from the menu, or enter a wavelength directly in the text box,
    and click &quot;OK&quot;. You can also decide not to add this line to the fit
    (perhaps if the wrong peak was highlighted) with the &quot;Cancel&quot; button.
    Note that the wavelength entered must be a value that maintains a
    monotonic increase or decrease of wavelength with pixel location so,
    for example, if you identify a line between two lines with wavelength
    identifications, its wavelength must lie between those two
    wavelengths.
</p>
<p>
    The &quot;Identify lines&quot; button will try to assign wavelengths to
    peaks in the spectrum that are not identified. Due to the way the lines
    are identified when constructing the initial fit, this may add new
    line identifications even if run immediately after the interactive window
    opens.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, individual points can be masked (excluded from the fit) and
    unmasked in the middle plot by using the <b>M</b> and <b>U</b> keys,
    respectively. A masked point is still plotted in the lower two figures,
    and is still considered when assessing the monotonicity criterion for
    adding new lines. In general then, points should be masked if their
    identification is correct but they hamper the fit (perhaps the reference
    wavelength is incorrect due to the peak in the spectrum being a blend of
    more than one line), whereas a line should be deleted if the
    identification is wrong.
</p>
<p>
    Once you are happy with the quality of the fit, click the
    &quot;Accept&quot; button and the image will be updated with the new
    wavelength solution.
