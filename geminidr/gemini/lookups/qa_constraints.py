# Gives BG band constraints in mags / square arcsec for given (GMOS) filter
# These are derived by Paul Hirst based on both
# http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/telescopes-and-sites/observing-condition-constraints/optical-sky-background
# And the model sky spectra in the ITC.
# There are uncertainties and caveats with these numbers, and discrepancies between different sources of data and
# different assumptions. Predicting sky brightness is not an exact science. These are probably affected by systematics
# at the +/- 0.3 level in some cases, especially i and z.

#NOTE. Nelson Zarate: Added JHK filter for NIRI. The user of this dictionaty is
# primitives_qa.py/measureBG() at the GENERALPrimitives level. Otherwise we would need
# to create a NIRI measureBG() primitive just to handle this dictionary.

# Gives CC band constraints as a function of magnitudes of extinction.
# From http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/telescopes-and-sites/observing-condition-constraints
# the value defines the maximum amount of extinction that classes as that band.

# Photometry to better than 5% (0.05 mags) is difficult due to scattered light from the
# focal reducer,  also we're using a nominal rather than measured atmospheric extinction
# so we take the photometric number to be less than 0.08 mags extinction.
