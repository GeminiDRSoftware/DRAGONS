****************************************************************
Example 2 - XD with Short-Blue + 111 l/mm grating - Point Source
****************************************************************

In this example, we will reduce the GNIRS crossed-dispersed observation of
the eruption of V3890 Sgr, a recurrent nova.

This observation uses the 111 l/mm grating, the short-blue camera and the 0.3
arcsec slit.   The dither pattern is the standard ABBA, one set for each of the
three central wavelength settings.

It is not uncommon to observe multiple central wavelength settings when using
the 111 l/mm grating. The idea is to increase the wavelength coverage and to
stitch the spectra together in the final step.

The data was originally published in Evans et al, 2022, MNRAS, 517, 4.
