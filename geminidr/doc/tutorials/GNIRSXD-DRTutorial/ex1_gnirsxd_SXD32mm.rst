***************************************************************
Example 1 - XD with Short-Blue + 32 l/mm grating - Point Source
***************************************************************

In this example, we will reduce the GNIRS crossed-dispersed observation of
a supernova type II 54 days after explosion.

This observation uses the 32 l/mm grating, the short-blue camera and the 0.675
arcsec slit.   The dither pattern is the standard ABBA, repeated 5 times.

The data was originally published in Tartaglia et al. 2018, ApJ 853, 16.
