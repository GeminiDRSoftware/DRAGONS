This is a tutorial for the reduction of GHOST spectroscopic data with DRAGONS.

GHOST is high-resolution spectrograph able to capture 363-950nm spectra of two
targets simultaneously at R 50,000 or one spectrum at R 75,000 with
simulataneous calibration source.  It uses two independent 1.2" fiber-fed
integral field units.  See the instrument's webpage on the Gemini website for more
information.

Here is a tutorial that you, the reader, can run and experiment with.  This
document comes with a downloadable data package that contains all the data
you need to run the example presented.  Instructions on where to get that
package and how to set things up are given in :ref:`datasetup`.

The example presented in this version of the tutorial uses data obtained
during the commissioning of the instruments.

The reduction can be done in two different ways:

* From the terminal using the command line.
* From Python using the DRAGONS classes and functions.

We show how to run the command line version.  The API usage will be documented
at a later time.

* :ref:`stdonetarget_example`

See the |RSUserInstall| to install the software if you have not already.
