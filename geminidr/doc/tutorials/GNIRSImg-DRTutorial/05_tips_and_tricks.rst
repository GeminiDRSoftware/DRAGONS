Tips and Tricks
***************

This is a collection of tips and tricks that can be useful for reducing
different data, or to do it slightly differently from what is presented
in the example.

.. _checkWCS:

Checking WCS of science frames
==============================
For GNIRS data, it is useful to check the World Coordinate System (WCS)
of the science data. DRAGONS will fix some small discrepancy but sometimes
the WCS are not written correctly in the headers causing difficulties with
the sky subtraction and frame alignment.

We recommend running ``checkWCS`` on the science files.

::

   $ reduce -r checkWCS @sci_images.list

   ======================================================================
   RECIPE: checkWCS
   ======================================================================
   PRIMITIVE: checkWCS
   -------------------
   Using S20200104S0075.fits as the reference
   S20200104S0080.fits has a discrepancy of 2.00 arcsec
   S20200104S0082.fits has a discrepancy of 2.01 arcsec
   S20200104S0091.fits has a discrepancy of 2.01 arcsec
   .

If any frames get flagged, like in the example above, you can still proceed
but after the reduction, do review the logs to check for any unusual matching
of the sources during ``adjustWCSToReference`` step, in particular the line
about the "Number of correlated sources".  If one of the highlighted frame
has a much lower number of correlated sources than the others, the algorithm
is unable to overcome the discrepancy; remove the file from the input list
and reduce again.

In many cases, where there are discrepancies ,``standardizeWCS`` will exit
with an error.  If that occurs, add ``-p prepare:bad_wcs=fix`` or
``-p prepare:bad_wcs=new`` to your call.  This will ask ``standardizeWCS``
to use header information about RA and Dec and offsets to try to fix the
WCS, or create a new WCS to the best of its ability.

This is very common with GNIRS for which the WCS can be accidentally inherited
from the previous frame.

.. note::  From the API, run ``checkWCS`` like this:

    .. code-block::

        checkwcs = Reduce()
        checkwcs.files = list_of_science_images
        checkwcs.recipename = 'checkWCS'
        checkwcs.runr()


.. _getBPM:

Getting Bad Pixel Masks from the archive
========================================
Starting with DRAGONS v3.1, the static bad pixel masks (BPMs) are now handled as
calibrations. They are downloadable from the archive instead of being packaged
with the software.  There are various ways to get the BPMs.

Note that at this time there no static BPMs for Flamingos-2 data.

.. _manualBPM:

Manual search
-------------
Ideally, the BPMs will show up in the list of associated calibrations, the
"Load Associated Calibration" tab on the archive search form (next section).
This will happen of all new data.  For old data, until we fix an issue
recently discovered, they will not show up as associated calibration.  But
they are there and can easily be found.

On the archive search form, set the "Instrument" to match your data, set the
"Obs.Type" to "BPM", if relevant for the instrument, set the "Binning".  Hit
"Search" and the list of BPMs will show up as illustrated in the figure below.

The date in the BPM file name is a "Valid-from" date.  It is valid for data
taken **on or after** that date.  Find the one most recent BPM that is valid
for your date and download (click on "D") it.  Then follow the instructions
found in the tutorial examples.

Associated calibrations
-----------------------
The BPMs are now handled like other calibrations.  This means that they are
also downloaded from the archive.  From the archive search form, once you
have identified your science data, select the "Load Associated Calibrations"
(which turns to "View Calibrations" once the table is loaded).  The BPM will
show up with the green background.

If a BPM does not show up, see if you find one using the manual search
explained in the previous section, :ref:`manualBPM`.


.. Calibration service
.. -------------------
.. The calibration service in DRAGONS 3.1 adds several new features.  One of them
.. is the ability to search multiple databases in a serial way, including online
.. database, like the Gemini archive.

.. The system will look first in your local database for processed calibration
.. and BPMs.  If it does not find anything that matches, it will look in the
.. next database.  To activate this feature, in ``~/.dragons/``, create or edit
.. the configuration file ``dragonsrc`` as follows:

.. .. code-block:: none

.. ..     [calibs]
..     databases = ${path_to_my_data}/niriimg_tutorial/playground/cal_manager.db get store
..                 https://archive.gemini.edu get

.. If you know that you will be connected to the internet when you reduce the data,
.. you do not need to pre-download the BPM, DRAGONS will find it for you in the
.. archive.

.. If you want to pre-download the BPM without having to search for it, like in the
.. previous two sections, you can let DRAGONS find it and download it for you:

.. .. code-block:: none

..     $ reduce -r getBPM <file_for_which_you_need_bpm>
..     $ caldb add calibrations/processed_bpm/<the_bpm>




.. _bypass_caldb:

Bypassing automatic calibration association
===========================================
We can think of two reasons why a user might want to bypass the calibration
manager and the automatic processed calibration association.  The first is
to override the automatic selection, to force the use of a different processed
calibration than what the system finds.  The second is if there is a problem
with the calibration manager and it is not working for some reason.

Whatever the specific situation, the following syntax can be used to bypass
the calibration manager and set the input processed calibration yourself::

     $ reduce @target.lis --user_cal processed_dark:N20120102S0538_dark.fits processed_flat:N20120117S0034_flat.fits

The list of recognized processed calibration is:

* processed_arc
* processed_bias
* processed_dark
* processed_flat
* processed_fringe
* processed_standard
