***************************************************
Example 4 - Nod-and-Shuffle Correct for Extra Order
***************************************************

In this example we will reduce a GMOS longslit nod-and-shuffle observation of
a high redshift quasar.  The particularity here is that the setting is quite
red and the second order shows up in the spectrum. The configuration uses the
OG515 blocking filter and the second order light appears at 1030nm. We will
show how to recognize the effect and then how to not include the light from
that extra order using the interactive tools.
