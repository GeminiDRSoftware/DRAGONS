This is a collection of tutorials for the reduction of NIRI data with DRAGONS.

NIRI is an infrared imager.  The spectroscopic features of NIRI have been
non-functional for several years now.  As such, this tutorial series focuses
on the reduction of NIRI imaging data.

In here are tutorials that you, the reader, can run and experiment with.  This
document comes with a downloadable data package that contains all the data
you need to run the examples presented.  Instructions on where to get that
package and how to set things up are given in :ref:`datasetup`.

The NIRI tutorial series currently contains only one scientific example, the
reduction of an extended source.  We show how to do that in two different ways:

* From the terminal using the command line. (:ref:`Example 1-A <extended_cmdline>`)
* From Python using the DRAGONS classes and functions. (:ref:`Example 1-B <extended_api>`)

We hope to add additional examples in the future.
