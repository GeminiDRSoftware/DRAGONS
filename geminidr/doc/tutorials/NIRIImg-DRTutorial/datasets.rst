Downloading the tutorial datasets
=================================

All the data needed to run this tutorial are found in the tutorial's data
package (KL??? name of the package, with URL).  Download it and unpack it
somewhere convenient.

.. highlight:: bash

::

    cd <somewhere convenient>
    tar xvzf KL???

The datasets are found in the subdirectory ``niriimg_tutorial/playdata``, and we
will work in the subdirectory named ``niriimg_tutorial/playground``.

.. note:: All the raw data can also be downloaded from the Gemini Observatory Archive.  Using the tutorial data package is probably more convenient.


Datasets descriptions
=====================

.. _dataextended:

Dataset for example 1: Extended source with offset to sky
---------------------------------------------------------

This is a NIRI imaging observation of an extended source, a galaxy showing
as a dense field of stars.  The observation sequence uses an offset to a nearby
blank portion of the sky to monitor the sky levels since there are no area in
the science observation that is not "contaminated" by the galaxy.

The calibrations we use for this example include:

* Darks for the science and sky offset frames.
* Flats, as a sequence of lamps-on and lamps-off exposures.
* Short darks to use with the flats to create a bad pixel mask.
* A set of standard star observations.

Here is the files breakdown.  They are included in the tutorial data package.
They can also be downloaded from the Gemini Observatory Archive (GOA).

A note about finding the short darks in the GOA.  Those darks are used solely
to create a fresh bad pixel mask (BPM).  In the archive, the calibration
association will not find those darks, they need to be search for
explicitly. If you need to find short darks for your program, do as follow:

* Set a date range around the dates of your science observations.
* Set **Instrument** to NIRI.
* Set the **Obs.Type** to DARK.
* Set the exposure time to 1 second.
