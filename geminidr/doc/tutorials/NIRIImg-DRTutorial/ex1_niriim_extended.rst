**********************************************
Example 1 - Extended source with offset to sky
**********************************************

This is a NIRI imaging observation of an extended source, a galaxy showing
as a dense field of stars.  The observation sequence uses an offset to a nearby
blank portion of the sky to monitor the sky levels since there are no area in
the science observation that is not "contaminated" by the galaxy.
