This is a tutorial for the reduction of Flamingos 2 longslit spectroscopic data
with DRAGONS.

Flamingos 2 is a near-IR spectrograph offering imagining, longslit spectroscopy,
and multi-object spectroscopy (MOS).  This tutorial focuses on the longslit
spectroscopy.

For Flamingos 2 imaging, see |F2ImgTut|.

In this tutorial, you will be able to run the examples yourself and experiment
with the process.  The tutorial comes with downloadable data packages that
contains all the data you need to run the examples presented.  Instructions
on where to get that package and how to set things up are given in
:ref:`datasetup`.

The Flamingos 2 longslit tutorial series contains three scientific
examples covering all three grating settings.

The reduction can be done in two different ways:

* From the terminal using the command line.
* From Python using the DRAGONS classes and functions.

We show how to run the same reduction using both methods.

The tutorials are:

* :ref:`JH grating <f2ls_JH_example>`
* :ref:`HK grating <f2ls_HK_example>`
* :ref:`K-band R3K grating <f2ls_R3KKband_example>`

See the |RSUserInstall| to install the software if you have not already.

.. tip:: If you are using the tutorials to guide you through the reduction
          of your own data and you encounter a problem, please review the
          :ref:`tips_and_tricks` and :ref:`issues_and_limitations` sections.
          They may contain the solution to your problem.

          Also, please use the :ref:`f2ls_wavecal_guide` to help you choose
          the best way to wavelength calibrate your data.
