********************************************
Example 3 - K-band R3K Longslit Point Source
********************************************

In this example, we will reduce Flamingos 2 R3K longslit observations
centered in the K-band of a high-mass X-ray binary.

The 2-pixel slit is used and the central wavelength is set to 2.2 |um|.
For expediency, we will reduced only the last eight frames of the long
sequence.  The pattern is AABB-AABB.
