*******************************************
Example 1 - JH and HK Longslit Point Source
*******************************************

In this example, we will reduce Flamingos 2 longslit observations
of the 2022 eruption of the recurrent nova U Sco.  The data were
obtained with the JH and the HK gratings.

The 2-pixel slit is used.  The dither sequence is ABBA-ABBA.

The results from the program's team were published in
Evans etal, 2023, MNRAS, 522, 4841.
