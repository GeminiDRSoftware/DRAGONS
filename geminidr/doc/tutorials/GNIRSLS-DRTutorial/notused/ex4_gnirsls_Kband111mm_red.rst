******************************************************************************
Example 4 - Beyond 2.3 microns K-band Longslit Point Source (111 l/mm grating)
******************************************************************************

In this example, we will reduce a GNIRS K-band longslit observation with a
central wavelength beyond 2.3 |um| with the 111 l/mm grating.  The target is
the hypergiant :math:`{\rho}` Cas.

The particularity of this sequence is that the arc lamp has only two/three???
lines and the OH and O\ \ :sub:`2`\  lines are absent beyond 2.3 |um|.  To get an accurate
wavelength calibration, we have to use the telluric absorption lines in the
science observations.
