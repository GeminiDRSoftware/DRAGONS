******************************************************************************
Example 4 - Beyond 2.3 microns K-band Longslit Point Source (111 l/mm grating)
******************************************************************************

In this example, we will reduce a GNIRS K-band longslit observation with a
central wavelength beyond 2.3 |um| with the 111 l/mm grating.  The target is
HD 179821, likely a yellow hypergiant star.

The particularity of this sequence is that the arc lamp has only five
lines and the OH and O\ :sub:`2`\  lines are absent beyond 2.3 |um|.  To get an accurate
wavelength calibration, we have to use The emission features in the sky spectrum of the
science observations.
