***********************************************************
Example 2 - J-band Longslit Point Source (111 l/mm grating)
***********************************************************

In this example, we will reduce the GNIRS J-band longslit observation of
a metal-poor M dwarf.

This observation uses the 111 l/mm grating, the short-blue camera, a 0.3 arcsec
slit, and is set to a central wavelength of 1.22 |um|.   The dither pattern is
two consecutive ABBA sequences.
