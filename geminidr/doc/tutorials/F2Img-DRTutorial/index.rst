DRAGONS - Flamingos 2 Data Reduction Tutorial
=============================================

This is a brief tutorial on how to reduce Flamingos-2 images using DRAGONS (Data
Reduction for Astronomy from Gemini Observatory North and South). It is based on
information found in the `GEMINI Flamingos-2
WebPage <https://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/flamingos2/>`_.

..  In order to carry on, you will need `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ (which
    is probably installed on your machine) and a few libraries. We recommend Python 3
    since Python 2 will be deprecated very soon. We also recommend that you use a
    `virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_ manager.

..  Please, start by checking the section :ref:`Get Ready <get_ready>` for
    requirements, installation and other steps. Once (or if) you have AstroConda and
    DRAGONS installed on your computer, you can jump to the
    :ref:`Loading F2 data <loading_f2_data>` section for details on loading a
    Flamingos 2 (F2) FITS file.
