Data Reduction with "reduce"
****************************

This chapter will guide you on reducing **Flamingos-2 imaging data** using
command line tools. In this example we reduce a Flamingos-2 observation of
a star and distant galaxy field. The observation is a simple dither-on-target
sequence. Just open a terminal to get started.

While the example cannot possibly cover all situations, it will help you get
acquainted with the reduction of Flamingos-2 data with DRAGONS. We
encourage you to look at the :ref:`tips_and_tricks` and
:ref:`issues_and_limitations` chapters to learn more about F2 data reduction.

DRAGONS installation comes with a set of useful scripts that are used to
reduce astronomical data. The most important script is called
|reduce|, which is extensively explained in the |RSUser|.
It is through that command that a DRAGONS reduction is launched.

For this tutorial, we will be also using other support tools like:

* |dataselect|
* |showd|
* |typewalk|
* |caldb|


The dataset
===========

If you have not already, download and unpack the tutorial's data package.
Refer to :ref:`datasetup` for the links and simple instructions.

The dataset specific to this example is described in:

    :ref:`about_data_set`

Here is a copy of the table for quick reference.

.. _setup_caldb:

Set up the Local Calibration Manager
====================================

DRAGONS comes with a local calibration manager that uses the same calibration
association rules as the Gemini Observatory Archive. This allows ``reduce``
to make requests to a local light-weight database for matching **processed**
calibrations when needed to reduce a dataset.

Let's set up the local calibration manager for this session.

In ``~/.dragons/``, create or edit the configuration file ``dragons`` as
follow:

.. code-block:: none

    [calibs]
    databases = ${path_to_my_data}/f2img_tutorial/playground/cal_manager.db get

This simply tells the system where to put the calibration database that
will keep track of the processed calibrations we are going to send to it and
that it should be used for retrieval whenever a processed calibration is
required.

.. note:: The tilde (``~``) in the path above refers to your home directory.
   Also, mind the dot in ``.dragons``.

The database file will be automatically created and the database initialized
when you first start the reduction. However, you can manually initialize it:

.. code-block:: bash

    caldb init

That's it! It is ready to use!

You can add processed calibrations with ``caldb add <filename>`` (we will
later), list the database content with ``caldb list``, and
``caldb remove <filename>`` to remove a file from the database
(it will **not** remove the file on disk). For more the details, check the
`Recipe System Local Calibration Manager documentation <|caldb|>`_.


.. _check_files:

Check files
===========

For this example, all the raw files we need are in the same directory called
``../playdata/``. Let us learn a bit about the data we have.

Ensure that you are in the ``playground`` directory and that the ``conda``
environment that includes DRAGONS has been activated.

Let us call the command tool |typewalk|:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ typewalk -d ../playdata/

   directory:  /path_to_my_files/f2img_tutorial/playdata
        S20131120S0115.fits ............... (AT_ZENITH) (AZEL_TARGET) (CAL) (DARK) (F2) (GEMINI) (NON_SIDEREAL) (RAW) (SOUTH) (UNPREPARED)
        ...
        S20131121S0075.fits ............... (F2) (GEMINI) (IMAGE) (RAW) (SIDEREAL) (SOUTH) (UNPREPARED)
        ...
        S20131121S0369.fits ............... (AT_ZENITH) (AZEL_TARGET) (CAL) (DARK) (F2) (GEMINI) (NON_SIDEREAL) (RAW) (SOUTH) (UNPREPARED)
        ...
        S20131126S1111.fits ............... (AZEL_TARGET) (CAL) (F2) (FLAT) (GCALFLAT) (GCAL_IR_OFF) (GEMINI) (IMAGE) (LAMPOFF) (NON_SIDEREAL) (RAW) (SOUTH) (UNPREPARED)
        ...
        S20131129S0320.fits ............... (AT_ZENITH) (AZEL_TARGET) (CAL) (F2) (FLAT) (GCALFLAT) (GCAL_IR_ON) (GEMINI) (IMAGE) (LAMPON) (NON_SIDEREAL) (RAW) (SOUTH) (UNPREPARED)
        ...
   Done DataSpider.typewalk(..)

This command will open every FITS file within the directory passed after the ``-d``
flag (recursively) and will print an unsorted table with the file names and the
associated tags. For example, calibration files will always have the ``CAL``
tag. Flat images will always have the ``FLAT`` tag. Dark files will have the
``DARK`` tag. This means that we can start getting to know a bit more about our
data set just by looking at the tags. The output above was trimmed for
presentation.


Create file lists
=================

This data set contains science and calibration frames. For some programs, it
could have different observed targets and different exposure times depending
on how you like to organize your raw data.

The DRAGONS data reduction pipeline does not organize the data for you. You
have to do it. DRAGONS provides tools to help you with that.

The first step is to create lists that will be used in the data reduction
process. For that, we use |dataselect|. Please, refer to the |dataselect|
documentation for details regarding its usage.


Two lists for the darks
-----------------------

Our data set contains two sets of DARK files: some 120-seconds darks
matching the science data and some 2-second darks to create the bad pixel
mask (BPM). If you did not know the exposure times of the darks, you
could send the |dataselect| results to the |showd| command line tool as follow
to get the information:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ dataselect --tags DARK ../playdata/*.fits | showd -d exposure_time
   -----------------------------------------------
   filename                          exposure_time
   -----------------------------------------------
   ../playdata/S20131120S0115.fits           120.0
   ../playdata/S20131120S0116.fits           120.0
   ../playdata/S20131120S0117.fits           120.0
   ...
   ../playdata/S20131121S0369.fits             2.0
   ../playdata/S20131121S0370.fits             2.0
   ../playdata/S20131121S0371.fits             2.0
   ...
   ../playdata/S20131122S0012.fits           120.0
   ../playdata/S20131122S0438.fits           120.0
   ../playdata/S20131122S0439.fits           120.0

(The list has been shorten for presentation.)

The ``|`` is the Unix "pipe" operator and it is used to pass output from
|dataselect| to |showd|.

Let us go ahead and create our two list of darks. The following line creates
a list of dark files that have exposure time of 120 seconds:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ dataselect --tags DARK --expr "exposure_time==120" ../playdata/*.fits -o darks_120s.list

``--expr`` is used to filter the files based on their |descriptors|. Here we are
selecting files with exposure time of 120 seconds. You can repeat the same
command with the other exposure time to get the list of short darks.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ dataselect --tags DARK --expr "exposure_time==2" ../playdata/*.fits -o darks_002s.list


A list for the flats
--------------------
Now let us create the list containing the flat files:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ dataselect --tags FLAT ../playdata/*.fits -o flats.list

We know that our dataset has only one filter (Y-band). If our dataset
contained data with more filters, we would have had to use the ``--expr``
option to select the appropriate filter as follow:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ dataselect --tags FLAT --expr "filter_name=='Y'" ../playdata/*.fits -o flats_Y.list

.. note::
    Flamingos-2 Y, J and H flat fields are created from lamps-on and lamps-off
    flats. The software will sort them out, so put all lamps-on, lamp-off
    flats, in the list and let the software use them appropriately.


A list for the science observations
-----------------------------------

Finally, we want to create a list of the science targets. We are looking for
files that are not calibration frames. To exclude them from our
selection we can use the ``--xtags``, e.g., ``--xtags CAL``.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ dataselect --xtags CAL ../playdata/*.fits -o sci_images.list

Remember that you can use the ``--expr`` option to select targets with different
names (``object``) or exposure times (``exposure_time``), or use it with any
of the datasets |descriptors|.


.. _process_dark_files:

Create a Master Dark
====================

We start the data reduction by creating a master dark for the science data.
Here is how you reduce the 120 s dark data into a master dark:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ reduce @darks_120s.list

The ``@`` character before the name of the input file is the "at-file" syntax.
More details can be found in the |atfile| documentation.

Since the local database has not been configured to automatically store
processed calibrations, the master dark must be added to the local calibration
manager using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ caldb add S20131120S0115_dark.fits

Now |reduce| will be able to find this processed dark when needed to process
other observations.

.. note::
    The master dark will be saved in the same folder where |reduce| was
    called *and* inside the ``./calibrations/processed_dark`` folder. The latter
    location is to cache a copy of the file. This applies to all the processed
    calibration.

    Some people might prefer adding the copy in the `calibrations` directory
    as it is safe from a `rm *`, for example.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ caldb add ./calibrations/processed_dark/S20131120S0115_dark.fits


Create a Bad Pixel Mask
=======================

The Bad Pixel Mask (BPM) can be built using a set of flat images with the
lamps on and off and a set of short exposure dark files. Here, our shortest dark
files have 2 second exposure time. Again, we use the |reduce| command to
produce the BPMs.

It is important to note that the recipe library association is done based on
the nature of the **first file in the input list**. Since the recipe to
make the BPM is located in the recipe library for flats, the first item in
the list must be a flat.

For Flamingos-2, the filter wheel's location is such that the choice of filter
does not interfere with the results. Here we have Y-band flats, so we will
use Y-band flats.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ reduce @flats_Y.list @darks_002s.list -r makeProcessedBPM


The ``-r`` tells |reduce| which recipe from the recipe library for F2-FLAT
to use. If not specified the system will use the default recipe which is the
one that produces a master flat, this is not what we want here. The output
image will be saved in the current working directory with a ``_bpm`` suffix.

The local calibration manager does not yet support BPMs so we cannot add it
to the database. It is a future feature. Until then we have to pass it
manually to ``reduce`` to use it, as we will show below.


Create a Master Flat Field
==========================

The F2 Y-band master flat is created from a series of lamp-on and lamp-off
exposures. They should all have the same exposure time. Each flavor is
stacked (averaged), then the lamp-off stack is subtracted from the lamp-on
stack and the result normalized.

We create the master flat field and add it to the calibration manager as
follow:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ reduce @flats_Y.list -p addDQ:user_bpm="S20131129S0320_bpm.fits"
    $ caldb add S20131129S0320_flat.fits

Here, the ``-p`` flag tells |reduce| to set the input parameter ``user_bpm``
of the ``addDQ`` primitive to the filename of the BPM we have just created.
There will be a message "WARNING - No static BPMs defined". This is
normal. This is because F2 does not have a static BPM that is distributed
with the package. Your user BPM is the only one that is available.


Reduce the Science Images
=========================
Now that we have the master dark and the master flat, we can tell |reduce|
to process our science data. |reduce| will look at the local database
for calibration files.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ reduce @sci_images.list -p addDQ:user_bpm="S20131129S0320_bpm.fits"

This command retrieves the master dark and the master flat, and applies them
to the science data. For sky subtraction, the software analyses the sequence
to establish whether this is a dither-on-target or an offset-to-sky sequence
and then proceeds accordingly. Finally, the sky-subtracted frames are aligned
and stacked together. Sources in the frames are used for the alignment.

The final product file will have a ``_stack.fits`` suffix and it is shown below.

The output stack units are in electrons (header keyword BUNIT=electrons).
The output stack is stored in a multi-extension FITS (MEF) file.  The science
signal is in the "SCI" extension, the variance is in the "VAR" extension, and
the data quality plane (mask) is in the "DQ" extension.

.. warning::

    The upper-left quadrant of this science sequence is rather messy. This
    is caused by the PWFS2 guide probe (see :ref:`issue_p2`). Photometry
    in this portion of the image is likely to be seriously compromised.

.. the figure below can be created using the script inside the ``savefig``
   folder.
