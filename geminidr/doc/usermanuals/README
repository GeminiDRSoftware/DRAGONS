Generating the primitive documentation.
---------------------------------------
There are two steps:

1) run the script to generate the docs from the docstrings and the parameter
   files.
     utility_scripts/generate_primdoc.py -d primitives/generated-doc

2) use the template to write the primitive_name.rst file that will load the
   generated subsections.   The template is "primmitive_createExample.rst" in
   "examples".   This is a manual, human-driven task.





Generating the recipe documentation.
------------------------------------
There are two steps:

1) run the script to generate the automated part.
      The generated file should have:
        * name of the recipe (as heading with ====)
        * module and name of recipe library
        * recipe tags
        * docstring which should include the type of inputs (tags) required.
        * the recipe

2) Then manually create the .rst that put them all together and adds additional
   comments.
