# gnirs/LS_MDF_table.py
#
# This file contains a look-up table for GNIRS long-slit (LS) data,
# with information on the locations and widths of the various slits visible
# on the detector. It is added to files in prepare(), from
# GNIRSLongSlit.addMDF().

# primitives_gnirs_longslit imports this dictionary to find the slit
# definitions based on a key generated from the 'telescope', '_grating', and
# 'camera' attributes of a file.

# columns are x-position of center of slit, width in arcsec, width in pixels

# For the LongRed camera on Gemini-North, at least for the 10/mm grating but
# possibly also for the other gratings, the slit is sometimes offset so that
# the full 49" length isn't visible, causing the single on-detector edge to
# vary in position. It seems to be a mostly bimodal distribution, so the values
# in the table here are something of a compromise which should work for both
# cases.
