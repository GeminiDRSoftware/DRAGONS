V2.1.1
======
This is a bug fix and compatibility releases. For a list of changes relative to v2.1.0, see :ref:`changes`.

This release offers support
for the science reduction of all current Gemini facility imagers: GMOS, NIRI,
GSAOI, and Flamingos-2.  GNIRS keyhole image reduction is also supported in a
limited way.

This software can be used to reduce Gemini imaging data instead of the
Gemini IRAF package.

This release does not include support for spectroscopy data.
