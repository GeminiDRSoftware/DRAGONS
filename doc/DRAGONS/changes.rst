4.0.0
=====

This release includes new support for longslit spectroscopic data from the
near-infrared facility instruments F2, GNIRS, and NIRI, as well as the
cross-dispersed mode of GNIRS.

New Features
------------

Additional interpolation modes during resampling.
  Cubic and quintic polynomial interpolation are now available. The "order"
  parameter that was previously used to designate the order of spline
  interpolation has been replaced by a string parameter that can take the
  value "nearest", "linear", "poly3", "poly5", "spline3", or "spline5".

Interface Modifications
-----------------------

**geminidr.core**

* Rename the "order" parameter in the various resample primitives to
  "interpolant", as described above.
* Rename the "threshold" parameter in ``transferObjectMask``
  to "dq_threshold", in line with other primitives.


3.2.2
=====

Bug Fixes
---------
**geminidr.ghost**

* Fix an issue where the GHOST reduction would fail if specific header
  values were not in the expected format.

Improvements
------------
* Reduce memory usage in ``flagCosmicRays`` and ``QECorrect`` primitives.

3.2.1
=====

Improvements
------------
**geminidr & gempy**

* Improved speed and success rate of wavelength calibration.

**geminidr.ghost**

* Added ``makeIRAFCompatible`` primitive to write order-combined GHOST
  spectra in a non-FITS-standard format that is compatible with IRAF.

Bug fixes
---------
**geminidr.ghost**

* Cause data validation to fail for echellograms without exactly 4 extensions.

* Fixed an occasional issue with bad pixels causing ``traceFibers`` to fail.

**geminidr.interactive**

* Fixed issues where certain values were not initialized correctly.

* Fixed stylesheet issues

New Features
------------

**gemini_instruments.gnirs**

* Preemptively added support for handling GNIRS data produced with the new
  detector controller software that will be installed in coming months.  An
  additional patch release will be issued once the gain, read noise, and other
  detector properties are known.

Documentation
-------------
* Several updates to the GHOST tutorials to fix errors and improve clarity.

Interface Modifications
-----------------------
**gemini_instruments.gnirs**

* New prims_motor_steps descriptor to support flat association with HR-IFU
and SciOps prism mechanism reproducibility workarounds adopted in Apr-2024.

**gemini_instruments.ghost**

* Change GHOST fast/low read mode from "fast" to "rapid".

3.2.0
=====

This release includes support for GHOST data reduction and the new CCDs
installed in GMOS-S in late 2023.

New Features
------------

Full support for the reduction of GHOST data.
  This is based on the external GHOSTDR package, with important improvements.
  Includes changes to the names and scope of primitives to better align with the
  other instrument recipes.

**Support for new GMOS-S CCDs installed in late 2023.**

Improvements
------------
**astrodata.wcs**

* Support for reading and writing log-linear wavelength axes to/from FITS.

* Support for reading and writing tabular wavelength information to/from FITS.

**astrodata.provenance**

* Renamed the ``PROVHISTORY`` table to ``HISTORY``, and changed wording in the
  code from "provenance history" to simply "history".

**astrodata.fits**

* Support reading ASCII tables when opening FITS files with astrodata

**geminidr.core**

* Creation of new ``skip_primitive`` parameter, e.g.,
  ``reduce -p skyCorrectFromSlit:skip_primitive=True`` which allows any
  primitive in a recipe to be skipped. Note that inconsiderate use of this
  may cause a recipe to crash because the inputs to the subsequent primitive
  in the recipe may be inappropriate.

* Creation of new ``write_outputs`` parameter, e.g.,
  ``reduce -p ADUToElectrons:write_outputs=True`` which will write to disk
  the outputs of the primitive.

* Allow input files to ``shiftImages`` to recognize tabs or multiple
  whitespaces as the delimiter

**geminidr.gsaoi**

* Modification to the `nostack` science recipe to not "store" the image but
  rather continue and detect sources in the images in anticipation of the likely
  stacking that will follow later.  The output images will have the
  `_sourcesDetected` suffix rather than the `_image` suffix.

**recipe_system.cal_service**

* Whitespace now allowed in directory paths (if quoted), e.g.,
  ``databases = "~/.my dragons/dragons.db"``


Bug fixes
---------
**geminidr.core**

* Set default ``calculateSensitivity.bandpass`` parameter to 0.001 nm to
  better handle pure spectra in flux density units.

* Allow ``display`` to handle non-standard extension names, which did not
  work as intended.

**geminidr.gmos**

* Fix the QE model selection for the GMOS-S EEV CDDs.

**recipe_system**

* Set the ``engineering`` flag to False for all data stored in the local
  calibration database, to ensure that it can be retrieved.

Compatibility
-------------
**geminidr.interactive**

* The interactive tools are now compatible with and require bokeh v3 and above.


3.1.0
=====

This release includes new science-approved support for GMOS longslit data,
along with new interactive tools to optimize the spectroscopic reduction.
The calibration service has also been refactored with significant changes that
the user need to be aware of.  Please read on.

New Features
------------

Science quality support for GMOS longslit spectroscopy, including nod-and-shuffle.
  Please refer to the tutorial, |GMOSLSTut|.  DRAGONS is now the official
  software for reducing GMOS longslit data in normal and nod-and-shuffle
  mode.

New browser-base interactive tools to support spectroscopy.
  The following primitives have an interactive mode that can be activated with
  the ``-p interactive=True`` flag:

  * normalizeFlat
  * determineWavelengthSolution
  * skyCorrectFromSlit
  * findApertures
  * traceApertures
  * calculateSensitivity

The GSAOI alignment and stacking is now done in DRAGONS.
  The package ``disco_stu`` is no longer needed.  The default GSAOI recipe
  will align and stack.  See the tutorial,  |GSAOIImgTut|

The bad pixel masks are now handled as the other calibration files.
  They are distributed through the archive instead of with the package.  They
  are also fully integrated into the calibration service.  See the various
  tutorials for details.

The calibration service has been through a large refactor.
  It is now possible to have the processed calibrations stored automatically
  (was a user step before), and it possible to serially search more than one
  database. See below for details on the new configuration file,
  :ref:`interface_3.1`.  For usage examples, see the various tutorials.

New imaging recipes.
   For Flamingos-2, GSAOI, NIRI:
       ``ultradeep``  See |F2ImgTut| for an example.
   GMOS:
       ``reduceSeparateCCDs`` and ``reduceSeparateCCDCentral`` (See |GMOSImgTut|
       for an example.

.. _interface_3.1:

Interface Modifications
-----------------------
**recipe_system**

* There has been many changes to the calibration service.  Most of them are
  internal but the one big change for the users is the configuration file.
  The configuration file now ``~/.dragons/dragonrc`` (was
  ~/.geminidr/rsys.cfg).  The syntax inside the file has changed a bit too.

  * New ``[interactive]`` section.  This is used to set the browser that the
    interactive tools will use.  Valid browsers: "safari", "chrome", "firefox"::

       [interactive]
       browser = safari
  * New format for the ``[calib]`` section.  The variable is now named
    ``databases``, plural, and multiple databases can be defined to be searched
    serially.  One database per line.  The name of the database can now be
    set by the user instead of being hardcoded to ``cal_manager.db``.  Two
    new flags can be set ``get`` and ``store`` to, respectively, "get"
    processed calibrations for that database, and "store" them to it. ::

      [calib]
      databases = /Users/someone/data/myprogramcal.db get store
                  https://archive.gemini.edu get


**geminidr**

* You must now ensure that the bad pixel masks (BPMs) can be found in a
  database.  The BPMs are no longer distributed with the software.  They are
  downloadable from the archive.  See the "Tips and Tricks" section of any
  tutorial (except Flamingos-2).


Improvements
------------

**geminidr**

* As mentioned above, the BPMs are now stored in archive.  Using the archive to
  distribute the BPMs will allow us to make new BPMs available rapidly, for
  example, when new bad columns appear in GMOS CCDs, after a catastrophic event
  like the amplifier 5 failure in January 2022, or when the CCDs are replaced.

* Several new or improved algorithms compared to 3.0.x.

Documentation
-------------
**geminidr**

* There has been some restructuring of the tutorials to better present
  multiple examples within a tutorial.

* Several new examples for Flamingos-2 and GMOS imaging tutorials.

* Several science quality examples for the new GMOS longslit spectroscopy
  support.

**astrodata**

* The three previously separated ``astrodata`` manuals, "Cheat Sheet",
  "User Manual", and "Programmer Manual" have been consolidated into one
  master document.  Please fix your link, |ADMaster|.


Compatibility
-------------
* DRAGONS v3.1 is compatible with Python 3.7 to 3.10.  The pre-release tests
  were done with Python 3.10.  Please note that DRAGONS v3.1.x will the last
  minor version to support Python v3.7.

* The conda package was built and tested against conda-forge dependencies.
  STScI has dropped support of the astroconda channel.  Make sure that you
  adjust your conda channels.

  If you already have a ``~/.condarc`` file, make sure that the channels are
  set as follows::

    channels:
      - http://astroconda.gemini.edu/public
      - https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge
      - defaults

  If you are installing conda for the first time, see the installation
  instructions here:  |RSUserInstall|

=====

Bug Fixes
---------

**geminidr.core**

* Fix bug where ``section`` start/end comparison was made on string, not
  numeric, values.

**gempy.library.transform**

* Fix bug that caused longslit spectra to have incorrect WCS, offset from true
  slit location.


Interface Modifications
-----------------------

**geminidr.core**

3.0.0
=====

This release includes new support for GMOS longslit data.  Reduction of
GMOS longslit data is offered only quicklook mode.  It does not produce
science quality outputs, yet.

Bug Fixes
---------

**geminidr**

* In imaging mode, the science recipes now include a call to
  ``scaleByExposureTime`` before the stacking step.  It is now possible to stack
  frames with different exposure times.

**gemini_instruments.gemini**

* Fix the GCALLAMP tag for NIR data to include the QH lamp.

**geminidr.core**

* Remove incorrect logging in separateSky when object and/or sky files are specified.
* Improve algorithm for separating on-source and on-sky frames.
* Avoid upsampling OBJMASK from uint8 to uint16
* In near-IR imaging mode, frames that fail to be sky subtracted are removed
  from the main reduction stream to avoid contamination.  The reduction continues
  with the "good" frames.  If all frames fail the sky subtraction, then all
  frames will be passed to the next step of the reduction.

**geminidr.gemini**

* Fix to the calculation of the CC-band used in nighttime sky quality assessment.
* Fix to the calculation of the BG-band used in nighttime sky quality assessment.

  PROVHISTORY.


Interface Modifications
-----------------------

**geminidr.core**

* ``biasCorrect``, ``darkCorrect``, ``flatCorrect``.  The ``do_bias``,
  ``do_dark``, and ``do_flat`` input parameters have been replaced with
  ``do_cal`` with more options than True or False.  Use ``showpars`` to
  inspect the options.


Compatibility
-------------

* Python 2 support has been dropped.  Starting with v3.0.0, DRAGONS requires
  Python 3.   All tests were run on Python 3.7, and this version of Python
  now serves as the minimal required version.
* Improved the F2 processed products backward compatibility with Gemini IRAF.


Documentation
-------------
