code from "provenance history" to simply "history".

**geminidr.core**

* Allow input files to ``shiftImages`` to recognize tabs or multiple
  whitespaces as the delimiter

**recipe_system.cal_service**

* Whitespace now allowed in directory paths (if quoted), e.g.,
  ``databases = "~/.my dragons/dragons.db"``


3.1.0
=====

This release includes new science-approved support for GMOS longslit data,
along with new interactive tools to optimize the spectroscopic reduction.
The calibration service has also been refactored with significant changes that
the user need to be aware of.  Please read on.

New Features
------------

Science quality support for GMOS longslit spectroscopy.
  Please refer to the tutorial, |GMOSLSTut|.  DRAGONS is now the official
  software for reducing GMOS longslit data.

New browser-base interactive tools to support spectroscopy.
  The following primitives have an interactive mode that can be activated with
  the ``-p interactive=True`` flag:

  * normalizeFlat
  * determineWavelengthSolution
  * skyCorrectFromSlit
  * findApertures
  * traceApertures
  * calculateSensitivity

The GSAOI alignment and stacking is now done in DRAGONS.
  The package ``disco_stu`` is no longer needed.  The default GSAOI recipe
  will align and stack.  See the tutorial,  |GSAOIImgTut|

The bad pixel masks are now handled as the other calibration files.
  They are distributed through the archive instead of with the package.  They
  are also fully integrated into the calibration service.  See the various
  tutorials for details.

The calibration service has been through a large refactor.
  It is now possible to have the processed calibrations stored automatically
  (was a user step before), and it possible to serially search more than one
  database. See below for details on the new configuration file,
  :ref:`interface_3.1`.  For usage examples, see the various tutorials.

New imaging recipes.
   For Flamingos-2, GSAOI, NIRI:
       ``ultradeep``  See |F2ImgTut| for an example.
   GMOS:
       ``reduceSeparateCCDs`` and ``reduceSeparateCCDCentral`` (See |GMOSImgTut|
       for an example.

.. _interface_3.1:

Interface Modifications
-----------------------
**recipe_system**

* There has been many changes to the calibration service.  Most of them are
  internal but the one big change for the users is the configuration file.
  The configuration file now ``~/.dragons/dragonrc`` (was
  ~/.geminidr/rsys.cfg).  The syntax inside the file has changed a bit too.

  * New ``[interactive]`` section.  This is used to set the browser that the
    interactive tools will use.  Valid browsers: "safari", "chrome", "firefox"::

       [interactive]
       browser = safari
  * New format for the ``[calib]`` section.  The variable is now named
    ``databases``, plural, and multiple databases can be defined to be searched
    serially.  One database per line.  The name of the database can now be
    set by the user instead of being hardcoded to ``cal_manager.db``.  Two
    new flags can be set ``get`` and ``store`` to, respectively, "get"
    processed calibrations for that database, and "store" them to it. ::

      [calib]
      databases = /Users/someone/data/myprogramcal.db get store
                  https://archive.gemini.edu get


**geminidr**

* You must now ensure that the bad pixel masks (BPMs) can be found in a
  database.  The BPMs are no longer distributed with the software.  They are
  downloadable from the archive.  See the "Tips and Tricks" section of any
  tutorial (except Flamingos-2).


Improvements
------------

**geminidr**

* As mentioned above, the BPMs are now stored in archive.  Using the archive to
  distribute the BPMs will allow us to make new BPMs available rapidly, for
  example, when new bad columns appear in GMOS CCDs, after a catastrophic event
  like the amplifier 5 failure in January 2022, or when the CCDs are replaced.

* Several new or improved algorithms compared to 3.0.x.

Documentation
-------------
**geminidr**

* There has been some restructuring of the tutorials to better present
  multiple examples within a tutorial.

* Several new examples for Flamingos-2 and GMOS imaging tutorials.

* Several science quality examples for the new GMOS longslit spectroscopy
  support.

**astrodata**

* The three previously separated ``astrodata`` manuals, "Cheat Sheet",
  "User Manual", and "Programmer Manual" have been consolidated into one
  master document.  Please fix your link, |ADMaster|.


Compatibility
-------------
* DRAGONS v3.1 is compatible with Python 3.7 to 3.10.  The pre-release tests
  were done with Python 3.10.  Please note that DRAGONS v3.1.x will the last
  minor version to support Python v3.7.

* The conda package was built and tested against conda-forge dependencies.
  STScI has dropped support of the astroconda channel.  Make sure that you
  adjust your conda channels.

  If you already have a ``~/.condarc`` file, make sure that the channels are
  set as follows::

    channels:
      - http://astroconda.gemini.edu/public
      - https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge
      - defaults

  If you are installing conda for the first time, see the installation
  instructions here:  |RSUserInstall|

  versus science mode.

Interface Modifications
-----------------------
* Internal Gemini catalog server URL updated.

Documentation
-------------

* Various fixes to the documentation affecting formatting, not the content.


3.0.1
=====

Bug Fixes
---------

**geminidr.core**

* Fix bug where ``section`` start/end comparison was made on string, not
  numeric, values.

**gempy.library.transform**

* Fix bug that caused longslit spectra to have incorrect WCS, offset from true
  slit location.


Interface Modifications
-----------------------

**geminidr.core**

* Expose ``min_snr`` parameter in ``findApertures``, make ``use_snr=False``
  the default, and estimate noise from pixel-to-pixel variations, regardless
  of its value.

Documentation
-------------

* Various fixes to the documentation.


3.0.0
=====

This release includes new support for GMOS longslit data.  Reduction of
GMOS longslit data is offered only quicklook mode.  It does not produce
science quality outputs, yet.

Bug Fixes
---------

**geminidr**

* In imaging mode, the science recipes now include a call to
  ``scaleByExposureTime`` before the stacking step.  It is now possible to stack
  frames with different exposure times.

**gemini_instruments.gemini**

* Fix the GCALLAMP tag for NIR data to include the QH lamp.

**geminidr.core**

* Remove incorrect logging in separateSky when object and/or sky files are specified.
* Improve algorithm for separating on-source and on-sky frames.
* Avoid upsampling OBJMASK from uint8 to uint16
* In near-IR imaging mode, frames that fail to be sky subtracted are removed
  from the main reduction stream to avoid contamination.  The reduction continues
  with the "good" frames.  If all frames fail the sky subtraction, then all
  frames will be passed to the next step of the reduction.

**geminidr.gemini**

* Fix to the calculation of the CC-band used in nighttime sky quality assessment.
* Fix to the calculation of the BG-band used in nighttime sky quality assessment.

**gempy.gemini**

* Ensure NIRI skyflats satisfy calibration association requirements

------------

**geminidr**

* Quicklook (``--ql`` mode) reduction support for GMOS longslit data.

**geminidr.core**

* Add ``remove_first`` parameter to removeFirstFrame primitive.
* Add ``match_radius`` parameter to adjustWCSToReference primitive.
* Add an IRAF compatibility primitive and recipe for Flamingos 2.

**astrodata and recipe_system**

* Provenance history stored with the data in tables named: PROVENANCE and
  PROVHISTORY.


Interface Modifications
-----------------------

**geminidr.core**

* ``biasCorrect``, ``darkCorrect``, ``flatCorrect``.  The ``do_bias``,
  ``do_dark``, and ``do_flat`` input parameters have been replaced with
  ``do_cal`` with more options than True or False.  Use ``showpars`` to
  inspect the options.


Compatibility
-------------

* Python 2 support has been dropped.  Starting with v3.0.0, DRAGONS requires
  Python 3.   All tests were run on Python 3.7, and this version of Python
  now serves as the minimal required version.
* Improved the F2 processed products backward compatibility with Gemini IRAF.


Documentation
-------------

* Fix various links in the documentation.
